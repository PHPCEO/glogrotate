glogrotate

# what
Gzip and remove logs generated by Go's glog: https://github.com/golang/glog

It will figure out the date of the log entries from the filename. It won't
touch files where the 'WARNING' and 'INFO' &c symlinks point to.

# how
glogrotate -base=/var/log/ -maxage=$((30 * 24))h myapp myotherapp

It'll gzip all non-current files in

* /var/log/myapp/*
* /var/log/myotherapp/*

and delete INFO files older than 30 days, WARNING files older than 2 * 30 days,
and ERROR files older than 3 * 30 days. See -help how to change the periods.
